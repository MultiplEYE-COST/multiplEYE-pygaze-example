# MultiplEYE PyGaze Example

As we are using PyGaze to implement the main experiment flow for the eye-tracking experiment, this repository contains a small example for how to use PyGaze. 
All the important functionality is explained.
Feel free to adapt it, play around with it and implement your own stuff. You'll find the official PyGaze documentation [here](http://www.pygaze.org/).
